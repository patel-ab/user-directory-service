# Spring Boot Advanced Concepts ‚Äî Learn & Revise

This repository is a **comprehensive Spring Boot REST API project**, designed as a structured platform to **learn, implement, and revise advanced Spring Boot concepts**.  
It applies enterprise-level patterns, clean architecture, and professional development practices ‚Äî serving both as a learning exercise and as a reference implementation.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

This is a **Spring Boot-based microservice-style backend** implementing a RESTful API for managing user or employee directory data. The design emphasizes clean separation of concerns and follows **Controller-Service-Repository architecture**.

It leverages:
- **Spring Boot‚Äôs auto-configuration and embedded server model** for rapid development
- **Spring Data JPA & Hibernate ORM** for relational data persistence
- **DTO pattern** to decouple API contracts from persistence models
- **Centralized exception handling** for robust and maintainable error reporting
- **Validation and constraints** to enforce data integrity at the API layer
- **Profiles and configuration abstraction** to support multiple environments (dev, staging, prod)

The project is modular and extensible, suitable as a starting point for real-world microservices.

## üß∞ Spring Boot Concepts Demonstrated

Below is a **detailed list of core, advanced, and enterprise Spring Boot concepts** implemented or planned in this project.

---

### ‚úÖ Core Concepts
- **Spring Boot Starters & Auto-Configuration**
  - Using starter dependencies for web, JPA, validation, etc.
- **Application Configuration**
  - `application.properties` / `application.yml`
  - Environment-specific profiles (`@Profile`)
- **RESTful Web Services**
  - Controllers using `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, `@GetMapping`, `@PostMapping`, etc.
  - Request body and path variable binding (`@RequestBody`, `@PathVariable`, `@RequestParam`)
  - ResponseEntity for flexible HTTP response status and payloads
- **Dependency Injection**
  - Field, setter, and constructor-based injection with `@Autowired`
  - Use of `@Qualifier` for disambiguation
- **JPA / Hibernate ORM**
  - Defining entities with `@Entity`, `@Table`, `@Id`, `@GeneratedValue`
  - Repository abstraction with `JpaRepository`, derived query methods
  - Pagination and sorting

---

### üî∑ Advanced Concepts
- **Exception Handling**
  - Centralized error handling with `@ControllerAdvice`, `@ExceptionHandler`
  - Custom exception classes and standardized error responses
- **Validation**
  - Bean validation with JSR-380 annotations (`@NotNull`, `@Size`, `@Pattern`)
  - Validation groups and custom validators
- **DTO & Mapper Pattern**
  - Decoupling persistence and API layers with DTOs
  - Mapping between entities and DTOs
- **Custom Queries**
  - JPQL and native SQL using `@Query` annotation
  - Projections for partial selects
- **Service Layer Orchestration**
  - Implementing business logic in services
  - Applying Facade pattern to group and orchestrate multiple service calls
- **Lombok Integration**
  - Reducing boilerplate code (`@Data`, `@Builder`, `@AllArgsConstructor`, etc.)

---

### üî∑ Enterprise & Optional Concepts (to extend)
- **Authentication & Authorization**
  - Spring Security integration
  - Stateless JWT-based authentication
- **Caching**
  - Declarative caching with `@Cacheable`, `@CacheEvict`
- **Asynchronous Processing**
  - `@Async` and `CompletableFuture`
- **Scheduling**
  - Scheduled jobs with `@Scheduled`
- **Monitoring & Metrics**
  - Spring Boot Actuator endpoints
- **Testing**
  - Unit tests with JUnit and Mockito
  - Integration tests with `@SpringBootTest`
